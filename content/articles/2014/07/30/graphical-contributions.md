Today we are going to talk about [bibalox](http://www.calcium-studio.fr/)'s awesome contribution to Lakka.

## The Contributor

Bibalox is a former chemist. He always was interested in graphics arts. He had got bored of chemistry, so he decided to start self-teaching himself designing by buying books and accurate hardware.

By the way, he thinks he is ready to starting a new career as a designer and is currently looking for a job.

## The Contributions

He jumped into the project a few weeks ago, proposed to give help on designing interface, and started working on a menu based on the awesome Niouby's work, releasing a new theme for the XMB-like menu:

  <source src="https://media.lakka.tv/articles/2014/07/30/graphical-contributions/menu1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  <source src="https://media.lakka.tv/articles/2014/07/30/graphical-contributions/menu1.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

Cool, isn't it? But that is not all, he imagined another menu from scratch. Something different from XMB-style menu. Something easier to use on any device (TV, Tablets, Smartphones) and nice to look at. Here is his proof of concept:

  <source src="https://media.lakka.tv/articles/2014/07/30/graphical-contributions/menu2.webm" type="video/webm" />
</video>

It is not completely done yet, but the result will sure be a great eye-candy. We really love his work.

## Next Release

The menu still lacks some entries to be fully usable. Yet, It is not as simple as adding graphics elements. It is rather a matter of implementing the menu settings API in [Retroarch](http://www.libretro.com/). It is not easy, but it is being taken care of. We believe it is a matter of weeks since we tag a new version of Lakka.
